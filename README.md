# Case-Study-Customer-Churn-Using-PowerBI
In this project a study was performed on a fictional dataset of a telecommunication company to find the reasons of churn among customers and understand the reasons behind this churn to be able to provide the necessary solutions.

This report was generated using Power BI Desktop and contains 5 pages:
1. "Overview" page which is the one shown above, in this first page some general overview like the reasons of churn, percentage of churn and states is given.
2. "Age Groups" page in which we start by analyzing the percentage of churn according to age, subscription duration and groups. Where we can see for example that as age increases the churn rate increases.
3. "Payment and contract" page, in this page we analyze the churn rates according to payment type and contract category. Mainly customers with yearly contracts instead of monthly contracts have lower churn rates. We can see that 3112 customers(around half of the customers) pay with direct debit for a monthly contract, the company should look at solutions to these types of customers since their number is big and have high churn rate around 54%.
4. "Extra Changes" page, here we compare the churn rate of customers with limited and unlimited data consumption plans.
5. "Further insights" page, some states have higher churn rates than others and this might be to competitors in this state.

This repository contains the Power BI report, the dataset used and screenshots of the 5 pages in the report.
